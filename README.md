# Bing Maps Extensions (formerly VEToolkit)

Bing Maps Extensions is a set of helpers that extend Bing Maps for Enterprise with functionality not implemented directly by the Bing Maps API.

**VEToolkit has been renamed Bing Maps Extensions!**
You can still download the older VEToolkit stuff for Bing Maps Ajax v6; however we are currently working on a new version of the toolit for the new Bing Maps Ajax v7 Control.
